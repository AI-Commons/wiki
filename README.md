## About

Welcome to the AI Commons wiki & community! **Please join in and contribute:)** 

## Mission

The mission of the AI Commons is to scale up the #AIforGood movement:
"Bringing together diverse global voices to address the worldâ€™s grandest challenges with AI."

We have a specific goal, which is ambitious, and achievable: 50 AI for Good projects, each deployed to 100 nations, by 2024.

This is ambitious, yet achievable.

## Challenges

The greatest challenges:
* How do we better connect problem owners with problem solvers
* How do AI models unlock the value of the data, without data owners compromising privacy or losing control of the data
* And more

## Goal of Wiki

This wiki's goal is to foster a community that helps to connect the AI Commons community, and grow a knowledge base around it. It's inspired by the [http://wiki.c2.com C2 wiki] of the mid-90s which had a large impact on software engineering & [http://wiki.c2.com/?SoftwareDesignPatternsIndex patterns], and the [http://tokenengineering.net Token Engineering wiki] which helped launch the field of Token Engineering. Consider all content here to be WIP:) This wiki also links to meatspace events.
